# CSharp-projects
These are my school projects. 
HW01: The task was to implement Tower, Projectile and Enemy classes (hw01-Assets-Scripts). 
HW02: The task was to partly implement the console application. The application allows adding and removing products and categories and saving logs and analytic data.
